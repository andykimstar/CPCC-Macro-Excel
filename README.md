# CPCC-Macro-Excel-File

## Description
In collaboration with Heather Roshon () from [Canadian Phycological Culture Centre](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-phycological-culture-centre/about) (CPCC) Biology Lab at University of Wateroo, a Macro Excel file was created to automate the data processing and collection to evaluate the performance of the CPCC Biology Lab
The project was initiated & led by myself in the product from design, development, testing and management.
It was initiated by myself with suggestion and presention to the Professor in effort to help the tracking of the Sales & Customers of the Lab. 



## Purpose
The Macro-Excel file carries the goal of eliminating the redunant manual labour, while saving time though the automation process. 
Hence the project automates the data processing and collection to evaluate the performance of the CPCC Biology Lab in University of Waterloo. 
It intends to organize the data, construct variables, and run statistical analysis.

This CPCC Excel computes & monitor the Orders into a CPCC Operation breakdown. Once the CPCC Orders has been entered correctly, the file is capable of tracking. 

I have recorded the overview of the content which can be find here: [Go to Demo](https://youtu.be/qNkoCGgKEuw).
